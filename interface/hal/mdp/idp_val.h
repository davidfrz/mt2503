/**
 *  \defgroup idp_val_vp
 *  \ingroup idp_val
 *  \brief This module defines the functionalities of IDP video process in idp_val.
 *  
 *  The input of this module is specific to video frame buffers, the 
 *  output is specific to display frame buffers, and the process includes 
 *  source pitch/clip, resize, contrast/brightness adjustment, rotation, 
 *  color format conversion, destination clip and pitch. \n
 *  This module does not control LCD, so the Display Driver will 
 *  not in auto mode. The user needs to bitblt the output buffers of 
 *  idp_val_vp via GDI API. \n
 *  The idp_val_vp_start() API is not a blocking API and it returns 
 *  once it set HW to work. \n
 *  This API set belongs to HAL and it is chip independent. \n
 * 
 *  \n
 *  The calling sequence is as follows: \n
 *  1. idp_val_vp_open() \n
 *  2. idp_val_vp_is_busy() \n
 *  3. idp_val_vp_config() \n
 *  4. idp_val_vp_config_src_buffer_addr() \n
 *  5. idp_val_vp_config_dst_buffer_addr() \n
 *  6. idp_val_vp_start() \n
 *  7. repeat step 2, 3, 4, 5 to display each video frame \n
 *  8. idp_val_vp_stop() \n
 *  9. idp_val_vp_close() \n
 *  \n
 *  Once configuration for video processing is set via idp_val_vp_config(), 
 *  those can be applied to each video frame set as input. Users only need to 
 *  invoke idp_val_vp_config_src_buffer_addr() and idp_val_vp_config_dst_buffer_addr() 
 *  for each frame if video frame buffers and display frame buffers are changed. 
 *  If callback function is set, once HW is done, idp_val_vp will callback to notify the user.
 *  \n
 *  MTK Chip supporting list: \n
 *  MT6236, MT6236B \n
 *  MT6276\n
