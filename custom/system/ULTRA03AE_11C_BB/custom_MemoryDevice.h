 [README , VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]
 --------------------------------
 After user configured this C header file, not only C compiler compile it but
 also auto-gen tool parse user's configure setting.
 Here are recommend configure convention to make both work fine.

 1. All configurations in this file form as #define MACRO_NAME MACRO_VALUE format.
    Note the #define must be the first non-space character of a line

 2. To disable the optional configurable item. Please use // before #define,
    for example: //#define MEMORY_DEVICE_TYPE

 3. Please don't use #if , #elif , #else , #endif conditional macro key word here.
    Such usage might cause compile result conflict with auto-gen tool parsing result.
    Auto-Gen tool will show error and stop.
    3.1.  any conditional keyword such as #if , #ifdef , #ifndef , #elif , #else detected.
          execpt this #ifndef __CUSTOM_MEMORYDEVICE__
    3.2.  any duplicated MACRO_NAME parsed. For example auto-gen tool got 
          2nd MEMORY_DEVICE_TYPE macro value.

 Step 4: Define the clock frequency of EMI and SFI

         By default, the highest EMI speed that can be supported by memory will be used 
         (define EMI_CLK to be DEFAULT).
         By specifying EMI_CLK to be ¡§104M¡¨, ¡§52M¡¨, ¡§166M¡¨, or ¡§200M¡¨ can force EMI/memory to be configured
         running at 104MHz, 52MHz, 166MHz, or 200MHz for special purpose.
         Please note that this feature is only available on MT6253D and MT6276! All other chip must set to 
         DEFAULT configuration.
         Available EMI_CLK configurations are:
         MT6253D: 104M, 52M, DEFAULT
         MT6276: 166M, 200M, DEFAULT
         other: DEFAULT

         For SFI, the highest SFI speed that can be supported by memory will be used by default
         (define SFI_CLK to be DEFAULT)
         By specifying SFI_CLK to be "130M", "104M" or "78M" can force SFI to be configured running
         at 130MHz, 104MHz or78MHz for special purpose.
         Please note that this feature is only available for platforms which support Serial Flash!

 Step 5: FDM Version Choose

         MTK NOR FDM is upgraded to 5.0 from 2006/Q3 to support large NOR-flash
         disk (multi-bank), for example, disk space larger than 64blocks.
         
         The major difference of NOR FDM 5.0 and NOR FDM 4.0 as below:
         1. RAM consumption
            To manage 32MB INTEL M18 NOR-flash disk, FDM 5.0 consumes 1KB,
            but FDM 4.0 takes 32KB.
         2. Addressable block numbers
            The addressable space of NOR FDM 5.0 is 65K-1 blocks, but NOR FDM 4.0
            is limited at 128-1 blocks.
         3. Idle reclaim and manual reclaim are implemented on NOR FDM 5.0.

         To enable NOR FDM 5.0 on NOR-flash disk, please enable the following 
         definition and customize custom_flash_norfdm5.c; the option is switch on/off 
         at customer site without deliver new library.
         
         [REMIND]
         ========
         To manage small disk space, like smaller than 64 blocks, FDM 4.0 is
         recommended.

 ****************************************************************************
*/
//#define __NOR_FDM5__

/*
 ****************************************************************************
 Step 6: This is an optional step special for NOR-XIP configuration only.
 
         This step configures the FS (file system) region information on NOR FLASH!

         By default, FS region is located the last bank of NOR Flash.
         For specific purpose, user are able to manually configure the
         
         Step 1. Start address of FS region on NOR-flash,
         Step 2. Total FS size on NOR-flash disk
         Step 3. The first drive (or partition) size of FS region. if no additional drive
                 on NOR-flash disk, it should be 0. For more details, please refer to REMIND.
         
         [REMIND]
         ========
         It is special for flash disk which has two drives (or partitions), the
         first leading is user drive, visible on USB disk, the second may be
         system drive, and invisible from USB disk.

         [VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]
         =======================
         1. Disable this definition and make auto Gen pick default setting from
            Memory Device Excel Database is recommend.
            
         2. Please assign the exact integer value in terms of sectors (one sector equal
            to 512 Bytes) in NOR_BOOTING_NOR_FS_FIRST_DRIVE_SECTORS.
            MUST NOT assign as
            (TOTAL_FS_SIZE - SIZE_OF_SYSTEM_DRIVE), because system will keep
            some spaces for disk management.

/*
 ****************************************************************************
 Step 7: For NOR raw disk configuration, if "NOR SUPPORT RAW DISK"
 
         If raw disk feature turns on, user are able to manully config the
         
         Step 1. Number of raw disk region, it should be 1 or 2.
         Step 2. Start address of raw disk region(s)
         Step 3. Total size of raw disk region(s)
         
         [REMIND]
         ========
         If project with __SYSDRV_BACKUP_DISK_RAW__ defined, the first disk
         would be treated as backup partition to backup NVRAM data.

         [VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]
         =======================
         1. The values in step 1~3 MUST be set if __NOR_SUPPORT_RAW_DISK__ defined
         
         2. The raw disk region and FS region cannot be overlapped
         
         3. Both the start address and size should be block aligned

 Step 8: For NOR-XIP configuration, if
 
         1. "SYSTEM DRIVE ON NAND" or 
         2. "SYSTEM DRIVE ON NOR" and FOTA "UPDATE PACKAGE ON NAND" 
         
         feature is enabled. Users are responsible to specify FS (file system) region 
         information on NAND-flash here!
         
         Step 1. Start address of FS region on NAND-flash,
         Step 2. Total FS size on NAND-flash disk
         Step 3. The first drive (or partition) size of FS region. if no additional drive
                 on NAND-flash disk, it should be 0. For more details, please refer to REMIND 1 and 2.
            
         For example, on 128MB NAND-flash, because code is already located on NOR flash,
         total 128MB NAND-flash space is reserved for NAND-flash disk. Reserve ~110MB for user drive,
         remain around 15MB for system drive.
         
         #define NOR_BOOTING_NAND_FS_BASE_ADDRESS        0x00000000
         #define NOR_BOOTING_NAND_FS_SIZE                0x08000000  // 128MB
         #define NOR_BOOTING_NAND_FS_FIRST_DRIVE_SECTORS 220000      // 110000KB
         
         [REMIND]
         ========
         1. It is special for flash disk which has two drives (or partitions), the
            first leading is user drive, visible on USB disk, the second may be
            system drive, and invisible from USB disk.
         
         2. For projects with __UP_PKG_ON_NAND__ defined, NOR_BOOTING_NAND_FS_FIRST_DRIVE_SECTORS will
            be ignored. That is, NAND flash is allowed to create only one drive (or partition) in this case.
            
         3. For "SYSTEM DRIVE ON NOR" and FOTA "UPDATE PACKAGE ON NAND" configuration, FOTA
            update package will be located in the top of FS region by default. Auto-Gen will
            reserve required space automatically.

         [VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]
         =======================
         1. The values in step 1~3 MUST be set if __FS_SYSDRV_ON_NAND__ or __UP_PKG_ON_NAND__ is defined !!
         
         2. The spare area is excluding from the FS SPACE !!
            
         3. Please assign the exact integer value in terms of sectors (one sector equal
            to 512 Bytes) in NOR_BOOTING_NAND_FS_FIRST_DRIVE_SECTORS.
            MUST NOT assign as

 Step 9: This is an optional step special for NFB (NAND-flash Booting)
         system only.

         Users are responsible to specify the drives (or partitions) on NAND-flash,
         
         Step 1. Start address of FS region on NAND-flash,
         Step 2. Total FS size on NAND-flash disk
         Step 3. The first drive (or partition) size of FS region. if no additional drive
                 on NAND-flash disk, it should be 0. For more details, please refer to REMIND.

         For example, on 128MB NAND-flash, code segment occupies 32MB, the
         balanced 96MB is reserved for NAND-flash disk. Reserve ~80MB for user drive,
         remain around 15MB for system drive.

         #define NAND_BOOTING_NAND_FS_BASE_ADDRESS         0x02000000   // 32MB
         #define NAND_BOOTING_NAND_FS_SIZE                 0x06000000   // 96MB
         #define NAND_BOOTING_NAND_FS_FIRST_DRIVE_SECTORS  160000       // 80000KB
         
         [REMIND]
         ========
         It is special for NAND-flash disk which has two drives (or partitions), the

 Step 10: This is an optional step special for eMMC booting system only.

         Users are responsible to specify the drives (or partitions) on eMMC,

         Step 1. Start address of FS region on eMMC,
         Step 2. Total FS size on NAND-flash disk
         Step 3. The system drive size of FS region. It must be a positive integer.

         For example, all User Area Partition will be used as FS region, 
         and reserve ~2.5MB for system drive,

         #define EMMC_BOOTING_UP_FS_BASE_ADDRESS         0          // 32MB
         #define EMMC_BOOTING_UP_FS_SIZE                 0          // All User Area Partition will be used as File System
         #define EMMC_BOOTING_UP_FS_SYSTEM_DRIVE_SIZE    5000       // 80000KB

         [VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]
         =======================
         1. All values MUST be set if __EMMC_BOOTING__ is defined !!

         2. Please assign the exact integer value in terms of sectors (one sector equal
            to 512 Bytes) in EMMC_BOOTING_UP_FS_SYSTEM_DRIVE_SIZE.

 Step 11. Enhanced Single Bank NOR Flash Support Configure Parameter

         Modify the size of block erase queue, which is the number of reserved 
         blocks. It is recommended to be 10~20% of TOTAL_BLOCK value.
         This value should be at least 3. Setting value less than 3 will cause errors.
         When FS size is reduced (by configuring NOR_ALLOCATED_FAT_SPACE), 
         set this value to 3 to avoid insufficient system drive space.

         [VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]

 Step 12. Multi Bank NOR Flash Configure Parameter

         Modify the size of system drive reserved blocks. 
         It is recommended to be 10~20% of TOTAL_BLOCK value.
         This value should be at least 3. Setting value less than 3 will cause errors.
         When FS size is reduced (by configuring NOR_ALLOCATED_FAT_SPACE), 
         set this value to 3 to avoid insufficient system drive space.
         The basic unit is 0.5 block. For example, reserved blocks can be set to 3.5 blocks.
