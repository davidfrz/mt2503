       Notification to application for some events, e.g., SSL connection is
       established or closed, etc. 

       Application verifies the event type and calls the corresponding handler:
       1. <b>TLS_HANDSHAKE_READY</b> is an indication of the result of 
          connection context creation procedure. tls_new_conn() might return
          TLS_ERR_WAITING_CERT for loading certificates and waiting response
          from MOD_CERTMAN. After received this message, application can then
          call tls_handshake() to start TLS handshake procedure.
       2. <b>TLS_HANDSHAKE_DONE</b> is an indication of the handshake result
          procedure. Application can call tls_read() to receive data from or
          call tls_write() to send data to the peer.
       3. For <b>TLS_READ</b>, application should call tls_read() repeatedly
          until TLS_ERR_WOULDBLOCK returned.
       4. For <b>TLS_WRITE</b>, application is allowed to transmit the holding
          data by calling tls_write().
       5. For <b>TLS_CLOSE</b>, application should call tls_delete_conn() to
          de-associate the connection with a socket id.

       of the connection", therefore, application received a indication with
       level set to TLS_ALERT_LV_FATAL should terminate the connection
