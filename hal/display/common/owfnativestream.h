/*!
 * \brief Image stream implementation for Linux.
 *
 * WF native stream is an abstraction of image stream or
 * a content pipe that can be used to deliver image data from
 * place to another. A stream has a producer (source) and a consumer
 * (sink) as its users.
 *
 * Streams operate on buffers, whose count is fixed at creation
 * time (minimum is 1, but for non-blocking behavior values
 * greater than 1 should be used.) Streams are meant to be used
 * strictly on "point-to-point" basis, i.e. there should be only
 * one producer and one consumer for each stream.
