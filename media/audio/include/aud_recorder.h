 * MMI the record is terminated for some reason and simply return FALSE.
 * 
 * In a more compilicated scenario, the client may wish to open another file 
 * to record or delete a file which has been recorded. To fulfill this requirement,
 * the callback function provides two alternatives:
 *
 * 1. If returning FALSE, the recording will be terminated. If returning TRUE,
 *    we continue the recording. Note that this is applicable only when the recording
 *    is termianted because of reaching size or time limit. For other termination 
 *    reasons, the recording will be terminated unconditionally even if returning TRUE.
 *    
 * 2. The pointer of current file handle which is being recorded to is passed as a
 *    parameter in the callback function. The client may open another file handle to
 *    be recorded to.
 * 
 * This mechanism could be useful when the client wants to write recorded data to 
 * another file seamlessly (such as the requirements from VM log).
