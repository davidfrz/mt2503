 * @param srcYUV  pointer to the buffer containing YUV422 interleaved (UYVY422) raw data
 * @param dstRGB  pointer to the buffer to contain the output RGB565 data
 * @param width   the width of the source image
 * @param height  the height of the source image
 * @return        If the function succeeds, returns 1; otherwise returns 0.
 * @remarks       The dimensions of source and destination must be the same.
 *                The width must be even.
