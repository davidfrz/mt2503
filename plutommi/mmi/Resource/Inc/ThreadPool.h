/* Description  : Defines ThreadPool class. How to use the Thread Pool. First
                create a ThreadPool object. The default constructor will
                create 10 threads in the pool. To defer creation of the pool
                pass a pool size of 0 to the constructor.

                You can use two approaches while working with the thread
                pool.

                1. To make use of the thread pool, you will need to first
                create a function having the following signature
                DWORD WINAPI ThreadProc(LPVOID); Check the CreateThread
                documentation in MSDN to get details. Add this function to
                the pool by calling the Run() method and pass in the function
                name and a void* pointer to any object you want. The pool will
                pick up the function passed into Run() method and execute as
                threads in the pool become free.

                2. Instead of using a function pointer, you can use an object
                of a class which derives from IRunObject. Pass a pointer to
                this object in the Run() method of the thread pool. As threads
                become free, the thread pool will call the Run() method of you
                r class. You will also need to write a body for AutoDelete() f
                unction. If the return value is true, the thread pool will use
                'delete' to free the object you pass in. If it returns false,
                the thread pool will not do anything else to the object after
                calling the Run() function.

                It is possible to destroy the pool whenever you want by
                calling the Destroy() method. If you want to create a new pool
                call the Create() method.
