 * Customer can fill following array to configure the audio play panel layout.
 * A/V Plug-in support six playback controls, progress bar and playing time for audio object.
 * 1. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PLAY
 * 2. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PAUSE
 * 3. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_STOP
 * 4. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_FAST_FORWARD
 * 5. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_REWIND
 * 6. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_MUTE
 * 7. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PROGRESS_BAR
 * 8. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_TIME
 *
 * A/V Plug-in will bind the "Pause" control with the "Play" control.
 * Therefore, customer does not need to fill NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PAUSE.
 * Also, customer does not need to fill NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PROGRESS_BAR and NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_TIME.
 *
 * Default setting description:
 * The first item is used when 0 <= object_width < (2 * icon_width)
 * The second item is used when (2 * icon_width) <= object_width < (3 * icon_width)
 * The third item is used when (3 * icon_width) <= object_width < (4 * icon_width)
 * The fourth item is used when (4 * icon_width) <= object_width < (5 * icon_width)
 * The fifth item is used when (5 * icon_width) <= object_width < (6 * icon_width)
 *
 * Another example (NPPLG_AV_CFG_DIFF_AUD_PLAY_PANEL_NUM is 3): 
 * const kal_uint8 g_npplg_av_cfg_audio_play_panel[NPPLG_AV_CFG_DIFF_AUD_PLAY_PANEL_NUM][NPPLG_AV_AUD_PANEL_MAX_SUPPORT_CTRL_NUM] =
 * {{NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PLAY, 0, 0, 0, 0},

 *  {NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PLAY, NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_STOP, NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_MUTE, 0, 0},
 * };
 * The first item is used when 0 <= object_width < (2 * icon_width)
 * The second item is used when (2 * icon_width) <= object_width < (3 * icon_width)
 * The third item is used when (3 * icon_width) <= object_width < (4 * icon_width)
 *
 * Note:
 * 1. The first item should have the "Play" control. Otherwise, user can not play 
 *    the audio by himself/herself.
 * 2. If the object height is tall enough to put the progress bar and playing time,
 *    A/V Plug-in will put the progress bar and playing time above the playback controls.
 * 3. 0: NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORT
 * 4. The width of each control icon (play, pause, stop, fast forward, rewind, mute) 
 *    should be equal.

/* 
 * Customer can fill following array to configure the video play panel layout.
 * A/V Plug-in support seven playback controls, progress bar and playing time for video object.
 * 1. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PLAY
 * 2. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PAUSE
 * 3. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_STOP
 * 4. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_FAST_FORWARD
 * 5. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_REWIND
 * 6. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_MUTE
 * 7. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_MEDIA_PLAYER
 * 8. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PROGRESS_BAR
 * 9. NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_TIME
 *
 * A/V Plug-in will bind the "Pause" control with the "Play" control.
 * Therefore, customer does not need to fill NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PAUSE.
 * Also, customer does not need to fill NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_PROGRESS_BAR and NPPLG_AV_CTRL_TYPE_TIME.
 *
 * Considering user experience, inline audio/video plug-in will handle the embedded 
 * video object and draw playback control according to the object size.
 * 1. If the displaying area of the video object is too small, user can not see 
 *    the video clearly. Inline audio/video plug-in will launch media player to 
 *    play the video.
 * 2. If the displaying area of the video object is too large, user can not see 
 *    the whole video in the page rendering area. It is not convenient if user has 
 *    to scroll the page again and again to see the video or press the playback/
 *    volume control. Inline audio/video plug-in will launch media player to play the video.
 * 3. If video size is not too small and user can see the whole video in the page 
 *    rendering area. User can play the video inside the browser or launch media 
 *    player to play the video.
 *
 * Inline audio/video plug-in has two limitations for the embedded video object.
 * 1. NPPLG_AV_MAX_VDO_WIDTH: maximum drawing width of the embedded video object
 * 2. NPPLG_AV_MAX_VDO_HEIGHT: maximum drawing height of the embedded video object
 * If the width or height of the embedded video object is larger than the limitation, 
 * plug-in will let user launch the media player to play the video. Plug-in has 
 * this limitation because it is not convenient if user has to scroll the page again 
 * and again to see the video or press the playback/volume control. The value of 
 * the limitation will be changed at runtime if screen rotate.
 *
 * Inline audio/video plug-in haS two configurations for the embedded video object.
 * 1. NPPLG_AV_CFG_MIN_VDO_WIDTH: minimum drawing width of the embedded video object
 * 2. NPPLG_AV_CFG_MIN_VDO_HEIGHT: minimum drawing height of the embedded video object
 * If the width or height of the embedded video object is less than the configuration, 
 * plug-in will let user launch the media player to play the video. Plug-in has 
 * this limitation because user can not see the video clearly when the drawing size 
 * is too small.
 *
 *
 * If displaying area is less than ((2 x icon_width) x ( 2 x icon_height)), plug-in also 
 * launches media player to play the video because plug-in must place a "Media player" 
 * icon to let user launch media player to play the video and must place a "Play" 
 * icon to let user play video inside the browser.
 *
 *
 * Default setting description:
 * The first item is used when the video size is too small or too large.
 * (1) too small:
 *     Width:
 *     a. The width of the object is less than the configuration NPPLG_AV_CFG_MIN_VDO_WIDTH.
 *     b. The width of the object is less than (2 x icon_width).
 *     Height:
 *     a. The height of the object is less than the configuration NPPLG_AV_CFG_MIN_VDO_HEIGHT.
 *     b. The height of the object is less than (2 x icon_height).
 * (2) too large:
 *     Width: The width of the object is larger than the limitation NPPLG_AV_MAX_VDO_WIDTH.
 *     Height: The height of the object is larger than the limitation NPPLG_AV_MAX_VDO_HEIGHT.
 *
 * If the video size is not too small and is not too large, we will apply the following rules.
 * The second item is used when object_width < (3 * icon_width)
 * The third item is used when (3 * icon_width) <= object_width < (4 * icon_width)
 * The fourth item is used when (4 * icon_width) <= object_width < (5 * icon_width)
 * The fifth item is used when (5 * icon_width) <= object_width < (6 * icon_width)
 * The sixth item is used when (6 * icon_width) <= object_width < (7 * icon_width)
 *
 * Another example (NPPLG_AV_CFG_DIFF_VDO_PLAY_PANEL_NUM is 3): 
 * const kal_uint8 g_npplg_av_cfg_video_play_panel[NPPLG_AV_CFG_DIFF_VDO_PLAY_PANEL_NUM][NPPLG_AV_VDO_PANEL_MAX_SUPPORT_CTRL_NUM] =
