 * Description:
 * ------------
 *  This file defines the interface of the Lock and Wipe Management Object
 *  (LAWMO) screen locker.
 *
 *  LAWMO lock is required by the operator. When the operator wants to lock the
 *  handset, it will send a message to the handset. After the Device Management
 *  (DM) parses the message, it will notify the screen locker to lock the
 *  handset.
