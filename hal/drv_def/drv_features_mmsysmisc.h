 * Description:
 * ------------
 *    This file defines driver feature options for 
 *      1. MM power control 
 *      2. MM internal memory manager
 *    According to chip series.
 *    This file should only be included by HAL modules and should not be 
 *    included by non-HAL modules.
 *    \todo consider to remove DRV_FEATURE__MM_POWER_CTRL_IF since API should be 
 *          the same in when HAL
 *    \todo consider to remove DRV_FEATURE__MM_INTMEM_IF since API should be the 
 *          same when in HAL
