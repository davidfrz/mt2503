 * OBEX Configuration API layer
 *
 *     When the OBEX protocol is ported, tradeoffs can be made between

 *     the configuration API, which controls these tradeoffs.
 *
 *     The configuration API employs two strategies. First, a set of
 *     conditional compile names allows certain areas of code to be included
 *     or excluded from the stack. Second, a set of types and constants
 *     govern the size of internal tables, buffers, and structures.
 *
 *     All of these #defines, except for those contained in the section
 *     explicitly labeled "non-modifiable constants", may be overridden
 *     in overide.h.

 *     The values are asymmetric and are not negotiated. This value is used to
 *     calculate our receive size (aka the peer's transmit size). Our transmit
 *     size is determined by the peer device.
