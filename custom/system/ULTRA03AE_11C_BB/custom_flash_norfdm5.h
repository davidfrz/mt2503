/*******************************************************************************
   Follow the 4 steps below to configure flash memory

   Step 1. Fill the flash bank (partition) information table,
           flash device features flexible, multi-bank read-while-program and
           read-while-erase capability, enabling background programming or erasing in
           one bank simultaneously with code execution or data reads in another bank.
           Each element in the table is the format as below:
           {bank size, bank number},

   Step 2. Modify the value of LSMT, you can see MemoryDevice_FlashDisk_FAQ for
           detail information

   Step 2. Define the toal sectors (512bytes) of system drive
           the remainder is the size of public drive
           If there is no partiton (just one drive, system drive)
           set this value to STORAGE_NO_PARTITION (0xFFFFFFFF)


   Note : Code region and FAT region can not share the same bank (partition)
