/* 1. Naming rule
 *    1) If named like MMI_CLOG_XXX, it's a fixed dependency, NO customlized.
 *    2) If named like CUSTOM_CLOG_XXX, it can be customilized.
 *
 * 2. Number abilities
 *    1) Please choose a proper log number abilities after belence the gains and the cost,
 *        more logs need more ROM/RAM size and may cost low performance, 
 *        some rough cost for reference:
 *       ->. 1 log needs one NVRAM record(~40 size), some RAM size (?)  
 *       ->. 1 log cache need RAM size (?)
 *       ->. 
 *    2) suggestion total log number no more than 750 (Missed/Dialed/Received: 250)
 *    3) The max unread number and total number of missed call is no more than 250 as use U8 type, 
 *      the value larger than 250 are reserved for other usage in the future.
 *    4) The number length is sync to PHB
 *
 * 3. Name abilities
 *    In sync with PHB scenario, CallLogApp does not same name information but to get it 
 *    from PHB, so it use PHB configuration for name abilities.
 *
 * 4. Styles
 *

/*---------------------- Number abilities ------------------------------------*/
/* Usage:
 * 1. Customer can set the max log number supported in CallLogApp.
 *
 * 2. The number threholds are split in several levels:
 *    a. Total number of all logs, e.g.  total 100.
 *    b. Total number of each log type from all SIM cards, e.g. call log: 100; sms log: 50.
 *    c. Total number of each log type per SIM card, e.g. SIM1 call log: 50; SIM2 call log 50.
 *    d. Total number of each sub log type per SIM card, e.g, SIM1 missed call log 30, SIM2 dialed call log: 30.
 *   
 * 3. The above number threholds are indenpendent with each others, 
 *    one potential limitation is the number of log from each SIM card should be the same.
 *   
 * 4. Once add a new log, CallLogApp needs to check all these number threholds to  
 *    know if need to delete one oldest log and which log is the oldest one.
 *
 * 5. Customer can choice if to use MAX_PHB_LN_ENTRY as the total number therhold,
 *    if use it, the load should be rebuilded once it' s changed, but easy to know where it is,
 *    if not, customer can set a number in the follow, just to remake CallLogApp yet.
