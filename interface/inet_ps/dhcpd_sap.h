       of network configuration parameters from any DHCP server in the attached
       network.

       The MAC address have to be passed to DHCP through mac_addr for setting
       the chaddr field in the DHCP request messages. By default, the
       parameters listed in abm_dhcp_get_ip_cnf_struct will be returned.
       If additional parameters are needed, the requested parameters can be
       passed to DHCP through parameters in this message. To request the
       additional parameters, each requested parameter is filled in the
       parameters array according to the option code specified in RFC 2132.
       The list ends by an entry of 0x00.

       Note that the handler of the additional requested options is not
       implemented in the DHCP task and the abm_dhcp_get_ip_cnf_struct,
       to request additional parameters, the implementers of ABM and DHCP
       should negotiate first to handle the new option properly.

          allocated IP address.

       2. ABM can also use this message to abort the address allocation
          process, when the user intend to abort the address allocation
          process. When DHCP received this message in UNBOUNDED states
          (INIT-REBOOT, REBOOTING, INIT, SELECTING, and REQUESTING),
          DHCP will reset all variables in the task and go back to INIT stae.

       ABM has to handle the condition that a MSG_ID_ABM_DHCP_GET_IP_CNF
       message is queued when the ABM_DHCP_RELEASE_REQ is sent. In this case,
       an MSG_ID_ABM_DHCP_GET_IP_CNF message followed by an
