/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * XA_INTEGER_SIZE constant
 *
 *     Defines the preferred width of counter variables. In some systems,
 *     accesses to 2- or 4-byte variables is more time efficient than other
 *     sizes, even though they may take up more RAM. The stack attempts to
 *     honor this preference, except where a greater size is required.
 *
 *     For instance, if XA_INTEGER_SIZE is defined as 2, 8-bit and 16-bit
 *     counters will both be defined as 16-bit variables.
 *
 *     XA_INTEGER_SIZE may be 1, 2, or 4 and will affect the definition
 *     of I8, I16 types used internally by the stack. By default, 2-byte
 *     integers are preferred.
