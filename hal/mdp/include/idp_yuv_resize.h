 *
 * Description:
 * ------------
 *   This file provides interface for video decode to display YUV420 frames 
 *   onto LCD. 
 *   This module controls MT6253 image resizer and LCD for video frame display.
 *   This is only an extension to legacy IDP design rather than MT6238 series 
 *   design.
 *   
 *
 *    The calling sequence: 
 *    1. idp_video_decode_open
 *
 *    2. idp_video_decode_config
 *
 *    3. idp_video_decode_config_yuv_src_address
 *
 *    4. idp_video_decode_start
 *
 *    5. HISR callback
 *
 *    6. idp_video_decode_stop
 *
 *    repeat 3 to 6 for every YUV420 frame...
 *
 *    7. idp_video_decode_close
