* Description:
* ------------
*  This fie is created to solve HAL High issue on 11BW11.44MP.
*
*  This file is a wrapper of driver layer global variables and should be maintained
*  be the related driver owner because it's bad design that low layer to extern global variable to 
*  upper layer, low layer should provide this wrapper interface, the context of these global variable
*  is also maintained and only can be modified by the related driver layer owner who has the
*  domain knowleage wholly.
*
*  But due to history reasion and a bad design when it born, Driver owner don't want to 
*  take it back to home even after great discussion, but we have to solve the 4N HAL high
*  issue and have to create this file, and just let it dead in the long time in the future.
*
*  This file it not belongs to the creater but really created by the creater, so announce here:
*  NO ONE IS ALLOW TO MODIFY IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE THE OWNER OF THIS FILE.
